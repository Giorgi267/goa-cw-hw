        elephant (L. cyclotis), and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). They are the <br>

        <h3><u><b>giraffe</b></u></h3>
        <p><i>The </i><u><b>giraffe</b></u> <i> is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. <br>
        It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. <br>
        Traditionally, giraffes have been thought of as one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. <br>
        Most recently, researchers proposed dividing them into four extant species
        due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA</i></p>
